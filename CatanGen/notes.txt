In his file we can keep track of things we want to do/aren't done
implementing, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERRORS TO FIX (& SOLUTIONS):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + NgOnInit throws an error because printResources() can't select an
   element that isn't rendered yet (bc dependent on the ngIf for mode).

 + Changing mode from Normal to Extension throws an error with printResource().


------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO-DO:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + Make the numbers 8 and 6 red.
 + Add ports to the UI along the board.

Options (use an Angular form for options to get live values?):
 + Normal vs. Expansion
 + True Random vs. Rule Abiding (three of same resource no touch)
    - For Rule Abiding, check each set of three adjacent tiles, and simply regen
      if it violates this rule.
 + Ports Showing vs. No Ports Showing
 + Randomize Ports vs. Set Ports
 + Desert in Center vs. Random Placement

 + EVENTUALLY keep track of initial settlement placements and analyze
   what makes a good placement strategy?
